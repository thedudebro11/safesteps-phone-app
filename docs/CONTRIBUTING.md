# 📘 Updating Documentation

Every code change must be paired with documentation updates:

| Change Type | Update These Files |
|-------------|-------------------|
| New API route | `/docs/api/API_SPEC.md` |
| DB updates | `/docs/db/DB_SCHEMA.md` |
| Tracking behavior | `/docs/logic/TRACKING_LOGIC.md` |
| Performance tuning | `/docs/performance/PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md` |
| Architecture changes | `/docs/architecture/STRUCTURE.md` |
| Any feature change | `/docs/CHANGELOG.md` |
| Major shifts | `/docs/SAFESTEPS_MASTER_SUMMARY.md` |
| Bugs solved | `/docs/ISSUE_LOG.md` |

This keeps SafeSteps maintainable long-term.
